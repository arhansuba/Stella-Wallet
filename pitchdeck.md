## The Future of Stellar Wallets is Passwordless

---

## 🎯 **Problem: Crypto's Authentication Crisis**

### **Current State of Crypto Wallets**
- 📝 **Seed phrases are user-hostile** - 12-24 words to memorize or lose forever
- 🔐 **Private keys are intimidating** - One mistake = permanent loss of funds  
- 🚫 **Security vs Usability** - More secure = harder to use
- 📱 **Poor mobile experience** - Typing long addresses and phrases on mobile
- 🌍 **Onboarding friction** - 76% of people abandon crypto due to complexity

### **The Cost of Complexity**
> *"I lost $50,000 because I forgot where I wrote down my seed phrase"* - Real user testimonial

**Result**: Only 4.2% of global population uses crypto despite decade+ of development
